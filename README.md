Scratch-Off-Game
================
This feature was designed as a sales component for the Hubbard Broadcasting websites.  There would be 
three images: a winner, a loser and a cover.  The script getting the games will do two random pulls one that will
pull the winning number and the second that will pull to see if the winner will be pulled ( matching the second 
randomly pulled number to the first randomly pulled number).  Two make the odds easier, lower the second parameter in
the rand function.  Every three minutes, if the user has not played, the game will reset itself due to a certain amount
winning in a given time.
